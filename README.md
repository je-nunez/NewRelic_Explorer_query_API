# NewRelic Explorer query API

The Explorer (remote) API to query the measures saved in New Relic

# WIP

This project is a *work in progress*. The implementation is *incomplete* and subject to change. The documentation can be inaccurate.

# Description:

This is an example of querying the metrics and measures stored
in New Relic by its different agents via the New Relic Explorer
API:

     https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/

# Note:

The `New Relic API Key` is different from the `New Relic License Key` for
a same account. The License Key is what the New Relic agents use to
determine the account to which upload the collected measures, whereas the
API Key is to do remote queries of samples stored in New Relic.

To obtain the New Relic API Key associated to your account, refer to:
